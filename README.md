# Effect of Average Temperature and Rainfall Against Floods in Indonesia
## Objective
The impact of flooding which is quite extensive on the community makes flooding becomes one of the most detrimental disasters in Indonesia. It can not be denied that flooding has become a government concern in the last decade. There are a number of factors that can influence the occurence of flooding such as temperature and precipitation on flooding. For this reason, this project was conducted to find out the effect of average temperature and precipitation on flooding in Indonesia. In this project, flood data, climate data, and geospatial datasets were used. These data will be visualized by using Tableau. With this project, it is hoped that it can add insight and knowledge regarding the effect of average temperature and rainfall levels on flood in Indonesia

## Visualization
### Average Temperature with 3 Types of LOD (Level of Detail)

### Floods in Indonesia

### Flood Frequency and Average Temperature

### Regional Clustering and Flood Duration in Indonesia

### Comparison of 5 Types of Trend Line between Average Temperature and Rainfall Levels

### Forecast of Average Temperature in Indonesia Each Month

### Comparison of Forecasts of Average Temperature, Rainfall Levels, and Number of Floods in Indonesia Each Quarter
